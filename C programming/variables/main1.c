// variable is place holders FOR SOMETHING ELSE ( IS THAT SIMPLE ! YES IT IS. :) )
// in more technical language it is memory location OF bunch of data-types where actual data is stored.


   // RULES
    // you have to start variable name with UPPERCASE or LOWERCASE , no NUMBERS first.
    // NO SPACING
    // NO SYMBOLS OTHER THAN UNDERSCORES
    // Don't name a variable any name of functions

    //specify what kind of data you want to store in ( integer , float , strings )
    int age;
    // assign value ( = ) is use for assign values
    age=21;// you can also do mathematical operations here (try "age=2018-1998")
    printf("Dhruv is %d years old",age);
    //here age is variable , so it is not in between quotations.
    // Now you know what6 we do with converging characters.
