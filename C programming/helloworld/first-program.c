// Hello friends , i am starting one basic series about c programming , i intended to add all basic topics.
// i will communicate with you with this comment line , i will also put one screen shot with output of code together
// i intended to add every details about functions and special things that need to be know
// and some of basics which can't be written i am providing one link in Ream.md file.
// but you are free to contact me at instagram page  " classy_@29 " mail me on " dhruvpatel2991998@gmail.com "



/* so How all this stuff works !?
    when c is programming language which uses compiler - compiler converts human readable codes into the machine codes
    that pc can understand compiler also check for some error on codes.

//some brief information about structures
int main()
//int - int is data type , data type is simply specify which type of data we are dealing with.
// main is function what follows our instructions and gives output
// what instructions?
{
    // here instructions are given to the functions
    // it helps function main to obtain output step by step.
    printf("learning C\n");  // these are statements , every statement should ended with SEMI - QUALUM " ; ".
    printf("its my first program");
    return 0;
    /* Technically, in C or C++ main function has to return a value because it is declared as "int main"
    which means "main function should return integer data type"
    if main is declared like "void main", then there's no need of return 0.
    Some compilers even accept and compile the code even if u don't write return 0. varies from compiler to compiler */
