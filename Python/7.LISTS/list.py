# Today we are going to learn al=bout lists
# lists in python is pretty much as list ofwords or numbers,
# lets take about Numbers


#ex

#numbers = [20,54,869,75,15,31]



#you can access individual items in list , just like we did it in strings

#numbers[2]

#869

#you can different values in perticular list itema

#number[2]=25

#numbers = [20,54,25,75,15,31]


#you can add new list item to the available list

#numbers + [90,55,25]

#numbers

#numbers = [20,54,869,75,15,31,90,55,25]


### but this method do it temperory only

#for permanent basis we have to use " dot operator '.' and one function called 'append'

#we will talk about functions soon
