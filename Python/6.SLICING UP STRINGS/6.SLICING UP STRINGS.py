#YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS FROM STRINGS

# LETS SEE HOW ITS WORKS

#just see screenshot 1

# so how it works
#EVERY CHARACTER IN STRING HAVE ONE POSITION , STARTING FROM '0' ( COMPUTER COUNTS FROM ZERO )

# > 0 , -13 (positions) WHite space also counts
#D> 1 , -12
#H> 2 , -11
#R> 3 , -10
#U> 4 , -9 
#C> 5 , -8
# > 6 , -7
#P> 7 , -6
#A> 8 , -5 
#T> 9 , -4
#E> 10 , -3 
#L> 11 , -2 
# > 12 , -1

#YOU CAN SEE THAT EACH ALPHABET HAS TWO POSITION NUMBERS

# TO ACCESS CHARACTERS TYPE VARIABLE NAME AND WRITE POSITION
# myname[5]
# Character 'v' will show up

# Slicing string

# you can slice bunch of characters from string

# myname[2:9]

#it means youcan take character from position 2 UPTO POSITION 9 , NOTE IT WON'T INCLUDE
# ALPHABET OF POSITION 9  >  T , TRY IT

#myname[2:]

#MEANS THAT ALL CHARACTERS FROM POSITION 2 COUNTS

#myname[:9]

#MEANS ALPHABETS SHOWS UPTO POSITION 9 ONLY

#myname[:]

#ALL ALPHABET WILL SHOW UP



#### YOU CAN SEE IN SCREENSHOT 2 SOME TIMES STRINGS DO NOT SHOW UP , IT IS BECAUSE OF WRONG ORDER.




# Do check my shell file for refrence
