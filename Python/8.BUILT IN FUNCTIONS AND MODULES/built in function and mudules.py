# FUNCTIONS is piece of code which executes some logic

# for example

# lets try exponent function
 
    var = pow(2,3)

    print(var)

# here 'pow' is exponential function , pow function requires 2 values

# '2' is to be powered , '3' is how much power we want to give

# 2**3 will do same thing but , pow is more easy in programming

# there are so many built in functions to know type " dir(__builtins__) " on command shellc

#to know the  functionality of built in function use 'help' fuction.

# write help(function name) to know what is does


# modules are extra functions , which contains extra functionality

# include module by 'import math' math is function

# how you will use ,  type 'functionname.(builtinfunctions)'
