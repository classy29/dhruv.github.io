#strings in a computer are simply set of words of simply words
#Example - Names , Sentences

#they are written between duble quotation marks like in many programming
# languages or you can also write between single quotations too in python generally

# ex "MY NAME IS DHRUV PATEL" OR 'MY NAME IS DHRUV PATEL' ( try it in IDLE )


# One thing is necessary to mention is that you have  be careful while using single quotation

# Normally quotation marks tells pc where strings Start/End if you use it in sentence like
# ' I don't think that ... ' ( try it on shell(idle) ) yyou will see different results


#you can also watch in screenshot attached " SyntaxError: invalid syntax " , something like that

# so i prefer to use double quotation always
