# so lets talk about Variables

# varieables are just placeholders for any data

# And tou should give varieable name starting with letter

#ex

#tuna is variable and i assign it a value 5

# you can run the code by RUN > Run module or (f5)

#try it on shell

#tuna=5 

#20 + tuna

#25 (lets try more )


#bacum = 20

#tuna = 3 // now tuna s new value is 3

#bacum/tuna // by deviding two variable we get alternatively 20/3

#6.6666
